# banglore_house_prediction
Welcome to my Bangalore house price prediction model repository. The aim of this project is to predict house prices in Bangalore, India, using various factors such as location, size, and amenities. The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset of house prices and their features to predict the price of a new house based on its features.
The code for this model is written in Python, and it uses popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy. In this repository, you will find the source code for the model, along with the necessary datasets and pre-trained models. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, so you can easily modify it to suit your specific needs. Additionally, detailed instructions on how to run the model and interpret the resul
The dataset used for this model consists of various features that influence the price of a house, such as location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, size of the house, and amenities. The model uses regression algorithms to analyze this data and predict house prices.
This model can be used by real estate agents, homebuyers, and sellers to gain insight into the Bangalore housing market. The model can help them make informed decisions about buying or selling properties. The model can also be used by data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts to learn more about machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

In conclusion, this repository provides a valuable tool for predicting house prices in Bangalore. It includes well-documented source code, datasets, and pre-trained models that can be easily modified to suit your specific needs. Whether you're a real estate agent or a data scientist, this repository will help you gain valuable insights into the Bangalore housing market.
